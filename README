Resurrected-Journal is a Java application for use in connection with jbackup.pl
(https://github.com/rnewman57/jbackup). It takes the XML file created
by Jbackup and turns it into a collection of HTML pages, index.html
plus one page per post. Sorry about the mixing of Perl and Java,
but if you can get a Perl app to run, the Java part is easy after
that. :)

Resurrected-Journal requires Java 1.6 or higher, and the instructions
below assume you can run Java from the command line.

More information is available in the project's "doc" directory.
