Resurrected-Journal is a Java application for use in connection with jbackup.pl
(https://github.com/rnewman57/jbackup). It takes the XML file created
by Jbackup and turns it into a collection of HTML pages, index.html
plus one page per post. Sorry about the mixing of Perl and Java,
but if you can get a Perl app to run, the Java part is easy after
that. :)

Resurrected-Journal requires Java 1.6 or higher, and the instructions
below assume you can run Java from the command line.

The current version is extremely crude, simply a first effort at
getting something up on Github and a proof of concept. Before long
there should be a version that uses CSS styling, so you can control
the appearance of your posts by editing the CSS file.

Bugs that actually stop the application from running should be
reported. For anything beyond that, please be patient.

The needed jar file is bin/resurrectedjournal.jar in the checkout code. 
Until it becomes a little more stable, I'm not tempting casual users by
making the jar separately downloadable.

To run jbackup, enter something like this in your command line shell:

perl jbackup.pl --sync --user={your LJ user name} --pass={your LJ password} \
[--journal={LJ community name}] --dump=xml \
--file={source-dir}/{journal or community name}.xml

On Windows it should work about the same, except that paths will look different
and you can't use backslash as a line continuation.

Once you've run that successfully, run Resurrected-Journal with a command
line similar to the following:

java -jar resurrectedjournal.jar -s {source-dir}/{journal or community name}.xml \
-d {dest-dir} -t "Archive Title"
